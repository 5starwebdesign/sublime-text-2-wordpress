Thank you for using the WordPress package for Sublime Text.

Thanks to new contributors (Hello @jtsternberg), this package has been updated to include the functions, hooks, constants and classes for WordPress 4.8.1, and is fully compatible with Sublime Text 3.

There is also an additional hooks autocomplete mode that will allow you to autocomplete the entire hook line. In order to trigger, you will begin by typing `aa_<action_name>` or `af_<filter_name>`.

For example, `aa_init` would autocomplete to: `add_action( 'init', ${2:'${1:callback}'}${3} );` where you have the option to tab-complete to add your callback.

Similarly, `af_the_content` would autocomplete to: `add_filter( 'the_content', ${2:'${1:callback}'}${3} );`.

We hope you enjoy the update.
